In this assignment, I analyze and compare four classification models—K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines—on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Repository. My goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various client and marketing features.

Using precision, recall, F1-score, and support as evaluation metrics, I identify the model that best predicts campaign outcomes. Visualizations and comparisons throughout the notebook highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model, providing insight into optimizing telemarketing strategies. Future steps include further model tuning and feature selection for enhanced predictive accuracy.
